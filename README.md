SERS Enhancement Factor statistical analysis

The SERS Enhancement Factor Statistical Analysis Tool calculates the average enhancement factor along with the maximum and deviation of the enhancement factor of the timer structure in interest.

This tool is capable of providing statistical insights along with 3-D visualization of the structures with Enhancement Factors being plotted.

Requirements:

This SERS Simulation Tool is currently available for MacOSX users. Windows exe is coming soon.
DDSCAT VTR file generated either by ddpostprocess or nanohub DDSCAT+
Substrate configuration; center particle dimensions, gap junction, and big substrates configuration
How to use SERS Simulation Tool:

Launch SERS Simulation Tool by opening the executable file. (Note: this file can only be used by MacOSX users)

Upon the launch of terminal, wait for a few seconds and dialog box appears. Enter the information asked by the program

Click 'Perform Analysis'. This may take a while since there are too many data points to process.
